### Hey,  Dudes  :wave:
I am Jacob, in my country you should read my name "Jakub".
I am from Poland, from land flowing with milk and vodka.... ops sory I meant honey... Ehh okay,I don't want to lie to you, you just need to type "Good polish guys" in you internet browser and you will understand what I mean. In this country everyone drinks, but a new generation of young people is a little worst in this than our ancestors. We have to spend one day at least to cure a hangover. Because on this day we are very bored we are looking for new interests. I have begun  programming.  It intrested me so much, that sometimes I used to forgot about drink in the next day. In this way I became Junior <font color="#287193">**.NET** </font> Developer, and now you can read my portfolio  :smirk:

:exclamation: **Of course I belive that you are a wise human and you didn't take whole my description as truth :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:** :exclamation:
